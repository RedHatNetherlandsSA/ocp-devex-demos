## Introduction to OpenShift Service Mesh
Service mesh is a technology designed to help developers address microservice architecture problems in a unified and centralized way.
It abstracts non-functional application components from developers and groups them in a centralized point of control so they can be reused by many or all microservices in an application.

Microservice architectures split the work of enterprise applications into modular services, which can make scaling and maintenance easier. However, as an enterprise application built on a microservice architecture grows in size and complexity, it becomes difficult to understand and manage.

Service Mesh can address those architecture problems by capturing or intercepting traffic between services and can modify, redirect, or create new requests to other services.

![OpenShift Service Mesh](../graphics/service-mesh-01.png)

Service Mesh, which is based on the open-source [Istio project](https://istio.io/), provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services that provides discovery, load balancing, service-to-service authentication, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring.

A service mesh also provides more complex operational functionality, including A/B testing, canary releases, access control, and end-to-end authentication.

### Core features

- **Traffic Management** - Control the flow of traffic and API calls between services, make calls more reliable, and make the network more robust in the face of adverse conditions.
- **Service Identity and Security** - Provide services in the mesh with a verifiable identity and provide the ability to protect service traffic as it flows over networks of varying degrees of trustworthiness.
- **Policy Enforcement** - Apply organizational policy to the interaction between services, ensure access policies are enforced and resources are fairly distributed among consumers. Policy changes are made by configuring the mesh, not by changing application code.
- **Telemetry** - Gain understanding of the dependencies between services and the nature and flow of traffic between them, providing the ability to quickly identify issues.

## Service Mesh Ecosystem

![OpenShift Service Mesh](../graphics/service-mesh-03.png)

OpenShift Service Mesh incorporates and extends several open-source projects and orchestrates them to provide an improved developer experience:
- **Istio** is the core implementation of the service mesh architecture for the Kubernetes platform. Istio creates a control plane that centralizes service mesh capabilities and a data plane that creates the structure of the mesh.
- **Maistra** is an open-source project based on Istio that adapts Istio features to the edge cases of deployment in the OpenShift Container Platform.
- **Jaeger** is an open-source traceability server that centralizes and displays traces associated with a single request. A trace contains information about all services that a request reached.
- **ElasticSearch** is an open-source, distributed, JSON-based search and analytics engine.
- **Kiali** provides service mesh observability. Kiali discovers microservices in the service mesh and their interactions and visually represents them.
- **Prometheus** is an open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model for storing services telemetry information.
- **Grafana** is used to analyze service mesh metrics.

The **3scale Istio adapter** is an optional component that integrates OpenShift Service Mesh with Red Hat 3scale API Management solutions. The default OpenShift Service Mesh installation does not include this component.

## Installing Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh

The installation of OpenShift Service Mesh has to be executed in three steps.
1. **[Install Prerequisites](#install-prerequisites)**
2. **[Install Service Mesh Operator](#install-service-mesh-operator)**
3. **[Create an instance of Service Mesh Control Plane](#create-an-instance-of-service-mesh-control-plane)**

### Install Prerequisites

First we have to install following operators in our cluster:
- [Openshift Elasticsearch Operator](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/tree/main/elasticsearch-operator)
- [Red Hat Openshift Jaeger Operator](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/tree/main/jaeger-operator)
- [Kiali Operator](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/tree/main/kiali-operator)

Procedure:
1. Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.
2. In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Operators â†’ OperatorHub.
3. Type the name of the Operator into the filter box and select the Red Hat version of the Operator. Community versions of the Operators are not supported.
4. Click Install.
5. On the Install Operator page for each Operator, accept the default settings.
6. Click Install. Wait until the Operator has installed before repeating the steps for the next Operator in the list.

**Note:** If you don't want to use OpenShift Console GUI for installing Service Mesh Operator, you can use [github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/tree/main/openshift-servicemesh).

- Install all prerequisites:
```shell
oc apply -k https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/elasticsearch-operator/overlays/stable &&\
oc apply -k https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/jaeger-operator/overlays/stable &&\
oc apply -k https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/kiali-operator/overlays/stable
```
```shell
namespace/openshift-operators-redhat created
operatorgroup.operators.coreos.com/openshift-operators-redhat created
subscription.operators.coreos.com/elasticsearch-operator created
subscription.operators.coreos.com/jaeger-product created
subscription.operators.coreos.com/kiali-ossm created
```

Wait for ES, Jaeger and Kiali operators to become ready.

### Install Service Mesh operator

![OpenShift Service Mesh](../graphics/service-mesh-06.jpeg)

- [OpenShift ServiceMesh Operator](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/tree/main/openshift-servicemesh/operator)

```shell
oc apply -k https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/openshift-servicemesh/operator/overlays/stable
```
```shell
subscription.operators.coreos.com/servicemeshoperator created
```

The Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator does not create the various Service Mesh custom resource definitions (CRDs) until you deploy a Service Mesh Control Plane instance.

### Create an instance of Service Mesh Control Plane

The Control Plane instance will be used to install and configure all necessary Service Mesh components. 

- Installs the Control Plane component of OpenShift ServiceMesh.

```shell
oc apply -k https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog/openshift-servicemesh/instance/overlays/default
```
```shell
namespace/istio-system created
servicemeshcontrolplane.maistra.io/istio-system created
```

This will create a new project named istio-system and will deploy a service mesh control plain.
We can watch creation of pods with following command:

```shell
oc get pods -n istio-system -w
```
The output should be similar to this:
```shell
NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
grafana-5555d857f7-tp78d                    2/2     Running   0          3m31s
istio-egressgateway-6865995bc7-68kl7        1/1     Running   0          3m31s
istio-ingressgateway-7b9966c9b-xncx2        1/1     Running   0          3m32s
istiod-istio-system-6cb497c876-ptwxg        1/1     Running   0          11m

## Getting Started with Service Mesh

Here, we'll learn how to prevent cascading failures in a distributed environment, detect misbehaving services, and avoid having to implement resiliency and monitoring in our business logic.

- [Install demo application and add it to the mesh](#install-demo-application-and-add-it-to-the-mesh)
  - [Create application namespaces](#create-application-namespaces)
  - [Create ServiceMeshMemberRoll](#create-servicemeshmemberroll)
  - [Deploy application services](#deploy-application-services)
  - [Enabling automatic sidecar injection](#enabling-automatic-sidecar-injection)
  - [Expose a service](#expose-a-service)
- [Visualize the ingress traffic with Kiali](#)
- 

### Install demo application and add it to the mesh
We'll install a sample demo application into the system.
It's a typical microservice application that could be installed on any Kubernetes instance with or without Service Mesh.

**Catalog** - Spring Boot project

**Inventory** - Quarkus project


- #### Create application namespaces
```shell
oc create -f ./demo/demo-namespaces.yaml
```
```shell
namespace/catalog created
namespace/inventory created
```

Before we start deploying our application we need to make sure we have the right access to our different application namespaces. 
The ServiceMeshControlPlane that includes Elasticsearch, Jaeger, Kiali and Service Mesh Operators, have all been installed at the cluster provisioning time. 
However for applications to communicate to each other accross different namespaces, we need to ensure that the ServiceMeshMemberRoll is also created.

- #### Create ServiceMeshMemberRoll

```shell
oc create -f ./demo/service-mesh-member-roll.yaml
```
```shell
servicemeshmemberroll.maistra.io/default created
```

Now we have successfully created a ServiceMeshMemberRoll which will cause a new service mesh to be deployed into the istio-system project. letâ€™s move on to deploy our application to our service mesh.

- #### Deploy application services

The following scripts will deploy our inventory and catalog service:
```shell
sh ./demo/istio/scripts/deploy-inventory.sh  && \
sh ./demo/istio/scripts/deploy-catalog.sh 3m
```

Let's check if our application is running:
```shell
oc get pods -n catalog --field-selector status.phase=Running &&\
oc get pods -n inventory --field-selector status.phase=Running
```
```shell
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
catalog-database-1-fbnws     1/1     Running   0          3m53s
catalog-springboot-1-c57cw   1/1     Running   0          3m8s
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
inventory-1-qmvsc            1/1     Running   0          4m33s
inventory-database-1-z96f5   1/1     Running   0          5m35s
```

- #### Enabling automatic sidecar injection

First, do the databases and wait for them to be re-deployed:
```shell
oc patch dc/inventory-database -n inventory --type='json' -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/metadata/annotations", "value": {"sidecar.istio.io/inject": "'"true"'"}}]' && \
oc patch dc/catalog-database -n catalog --type='json' -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/metadata/annotations", "value": {"sidecar.istio.io/inject": "'"true"'"}}]' && \
oc rollout status -w dc/inventory-database -n inventory && \
oc rollout status -w dc/catalog-database -n catalog
```
Next, letâ€™s add sidecars to our services and wait for them to be re-deployed:
```shell
oc patch dc/inventory -n inventory --type='json' -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/metadata/annotations", "value": {"sidecar.istio.io/inject": "'"true"'"}}]' && \
oc rollout latest dc/inventory -n inventory && \
oc patch dc/catalog-springboot -n catalog --type='json' -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/metadata/annotations", "value": {"sidecar.istio.io/inject": "'"true"'"}}]' && \
oc rollout status -w dc/inventory -n inventory && \
oc rollout status -w dc/catalog-springboot -n catalog
```
This should also take about 1 minute to finish. 

When itâ€™s done, verify that the inventory-database is running with 2 pods (2/2 in the READY column) with this command:
```shell
oc get pods -n catalog --field-selector status.phase=Running &&\
oc get pods -n inventory --field-selector status.phase=Running
```
```shell
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
catalog-database-2-qglw8     2/2     Running   0          89s
catalog-springboot-2-jhxtf   2/2     Running   0          36s
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
inventory-2-pqc2s            2/2     Running   0          38s
inventory-database-2-pmnnp   2/2     Running   0          90s
```

- #### Expose a service

Next, letâ€™s create an ingress gateway to allow ingress traffic to the mesh.
And a virtual service to send incoming traffic to our app catalog service. 
```shell
oc create -f ./demo/catalog/rules/catalog-default.yaml -n catalog
```
```shell
gateway.networking.istio.io/catalog-gateway created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/catalog-default created
```

- #### Let's test it!

Test that the gateway and VirtualService have been set correctly.

Set the Gateway URL.
```shell
export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```
Set the port number. 
```shell
export TARGET_PORT=$(oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.port.targetPort}')
```

Test a page that has been explicitly exposed.
```shell
curl -s -I "$GATEWAY_URL/services/products"
```

The expected result is 200.

do curl -o /dev/null -s ${GATEWAY_URL}; \
sleep 2; done

## Advanced Service Mesh Development

Here, we will learn the advanced use cases of service mesh. The lab showcases features:
- Fault Injection
- Traffic Shifting
- Circuit Breaking
- Rate Limiting


Letâ€™s inject a failure (500 status) in 50% of requests to inventory microservices. Edit inventory-default.yaml as below.

Open the empty inventory-vs-fault.yaml file in inventory/rules directory and copy the following codes.

while true; \
do curl -o /dev/null -s ${GATEWAY_URL}; \
sleep 2; done


siege --verbose --time=1M --concurrent=10 'http://'$GATEWAY_URL
